As a general tip for all classes: Bring yourself a shield and/or Annilys in hotbar. They are very useful when you are about to take huge damage or trying to revive someone in late game.

# Presets of builds for WR:

  Here's some presets if you don't really wanna spend time to constumize a set.
  Charms and Skill layout are the key points. Armor is only a direction.

## [Guardian](https://www.ohthemisery.tk/builder/m=None&o=Blackblood%20Coagulant-3&h=Stonewrought%20Helmet-3&c=Crimson%20Ribcage-3&l=Mycelic%20Skin-3&b=Shrouded%20Sabatons-3&charm=Arc-_Aegis-4-W,Swi-efense-2-W,Sed-efense-3-W,Ser-ineage-3-W)

[Another set with better speed if you enjoy saturation stack](https://www.ohthemisery.tk/builder/m=None&o=Hexborn%20Shard-3&h=Stonewrought%20Helmet-3&c=Hycenea's%20Chains-3&l=Core-Injected%20Safety%20Suit-3&b=Aether%20Threads-3&charm=Arc-_Aegis-4-W,Swi-efense-2-W,Sed-efense-3-W,Ser-ineage-3-W)

Gallery armor: 4 tank, offhand shield, mainhand Soulsinger / Annilys

### Skill layout

Base: DLine 2u, Toughness 2u, Riptose 2, Shield Bash 2 (the left 2 can be any)

Spec: Bodyguard 0

### Gameplay

Time and sync your and another guardian's wall.

Wall doesn't expand to anywhere has a lower Y than you. It has only 5 blocks height as well.

Golem: Whose wall is it then who (call them A for next prase) A Shield Bash golem first. B Bash it next. (B cast Wall.) B Challenge it next. B Bash it next. (A cast Wall.) A Challenge it next. A guardian Bash it next. (<- Repeat)

Walk around with vindicators and pick up Bezoars in late waves. They do hurt a lot. But still be careful of creepers. When one silence creeper explode, there's always another, and another after another.
