The sub page of NDDPlus wiki. Directs you to each part of the Sanguine Halls, the map of Gallery of Fear build guide by sidebar.

You could use */ps [username]* to check what piece others currently missing. It's very helpful for the guy doing box (usually one of the guardian or paladin)

Example:

	/ps HuiyingZz

As a general tip for all non-guardian classes: Shield can block golem's melee and attack but dash/meteor/vindicators/magic missle breaks it. In that case, Annilys may help you survive.

Current Group WR (wave 91) Strat: 2 Guardian, 1 Paladin, 1 Harb

# Presets of builds:

  Here's some presets if you don't really wanna spend time to constumize a set.
  Charms and Skill layout are the key points. Armor is only a direction.

## [Guardian](https://www.ohthemisery.tk/builder/m=None&o=Blackblood%20Coagulant-3&h=Stonewrought%20Helmet-3&c=Crimson%20Ribcage-3&l=Mycelic%20Skin-3&b=Shrouded%20Sabatons-3&charm=Arc-_Aegis-4-W,Swi-efense-2-W,Sed-efense-3-W,Ser-ineage-3-W)

### [Another build if no cleric in team](https://www.ohthemisery.tk/builder/charm=Arc-_Aegis-4-W,Fec-Basket-3-G,Del-_Fruit-2-G,Ser-ineage-3-W)

Gallery armor: 4 tank, offhand shield, mainhand Soulsinger / Annilys 

### Skill layout

Base: DLine 2u, Toughness 2u,  Riptose 2, Shield Bash 2 (the left 2 can be any)

Spec: Bodyguard 0

### Gameplay

If you are the only guardian and no paladin in team, better just don't run guardian. If you are the only guardian and only 1 paladin in team, discusse with your team about how to get enlightment at start of each round without enlightment, and get your Mountain Dew ready. If you have 2 guardians in team, time and sync your and another guardian's wall.

Wall doesn't expand to anywhere has a lower Y than you. Wall has only 5 blocks height.

Against golem's aggro changing: Whose wall is it then who (call them A for next prase) A Shield Bash golem first. B Bash it next. (B cast Wall.) B Challenge it next. B Bash it next. (A cast Wall.) A Challenge it next. A guardian Bash it next. (<- Repeat)

Walk around with vindicators and pick up Bezoars in late waves. They do hurt a lot. But still be careful of creepers. When one silence creeper explode, there's always another, and another after another.

## [Paladin](https://www.ohthemisery.tk/builder/m=EX%20Prismatic%20Blade-3&o=Timerift%20Stave-3&h=Sanguine%20Hood-3&c=EX%20Archmage's%20Vestment-3&l=Circuit%20Breaker-3&b=Energized%20Enclosure-3&charm=Aut-illery-3-C,Zoe-c_Geas-2-C,Dis-diance-3-C,Swi-diance-3-C,Les-diance-1-C)

Gallery armor: 2+2 tank/magic, offhand Aptitude 2, mainhand Aptitude 1 wand (Shard of the Dreamer)

### Skill layout

Base: Boon 2u, HoL 2u(HoL / Crusade / Blessing . Personally I prefer HoL), Crusade 2, DJ 2, Rain / Blessing (use it with enhance) 2

Spec: Bell 0

### Gameplay

Try not to get 1 tap in first waves. Try not to fall asleep in late waves.

Don't try to melee unless you want to end this run.

## [Harb](https://www.ohthemisery.tk/builder/m=Hexbound%20Elixir-3&o=Timerift%20Stave-3&h=Stonewrought%20Helmet-3&c=Silver%20Vestment-3&l=Circuit%20Breaker-3&b=Energized%20Enclosure-3&charm=Ove-_Flask-2-A,Hea-_Forge-3-A,Exp-sanity-3-A,Exp-illery-3-A,Les-illery-1-A)

Gallery armor: 2+2 tank/magic, offhand Aptitude 2, mainhand gallery bag (Nightbarb Flask)

### Skill layout

Base: UA 2u, Brutal 2u (either Brutal or AA enhance), AA 2, Gruesome 2, Bezoar 2

Spec: Taboo 0

### Gameplay

There's still some arguments about run EE or not. It's a math problem about does EE bring more damage boost than -1 level on each Brutal (and its enhance) and Gruesome. The reason no taboo is it will lower your mistake rate too many, or say too risky to use.

Cast UA/AA on guardian's body can hit 90% of the mobs.

UA is your main pot regen instead of Bezoar. That is for healing.

## [Assassin](https://www.ohthemisery.tk/builder/m=Cutter%20of%20Eons-3&o=Argentum%20Arbitrium-3&h=Fungal%20Fury-3&c=Thief's%20Raiment-3&l=Melded%20Bronzeskin-3&b=Aether%20Threads-3&charm=Ech-_Beast-5-R,Spe-_Shoot-1-R,Spr-Sheath-2-R,Anc-wstone-3-R,Les-curing-1-R)

Gallery armor: 4 melee, offhand melee, mainhand Quake sword (Rivers of Blood)

### Skill layout

Base: AS 2u, DT 2, VC 2, BMB 2, Smokescreen 2u

Spec: Bodkin 2, other 1 each

### Gameplay

Repeat of Kill -> VC -> Stealth -> Kill. Elites are usually not your highest prioty.

## [Hunter](https://www.ohthemisery.tk/builder/m=Witchbane%20Revolver-3&o=Silvari%20Coin-3&h=Falling%20Blades-3&c=Timepiece%20Plate-3&l=Laboratory%20Apron-3&b=Dichen%20Resolve-3&charm=Har-s_Roar-3-S,Fra-_Shaft-1-S,Dra-'s_Eye-2-S,Sha-sman's-3-S,Emp-acious-3-S)

Gallery armor: 2+2 tank/proj, offhand proj, mainhand QC 4 crossbow (Ravenclaws) for normal mobs, Piercing 10 crossbow (Heart Stopper) for volley and PStrike.

### Skill layout

Base: Swiftness 2, EE 2, Volley 2, Sharpshooter 2u, Wind Bomb 2u

Spec: Split Arrow 2, other 1 each

### Gameplay

Spam your right click for the love of god Pinning Shot. Spam your EE for crashing teammate's FPS (and apply Vuln). Spam your Wind Bomb for Crowd Control. Save your PStrike for elties.
