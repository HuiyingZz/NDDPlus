# Presets of builds:

  Here's some presets if you don't really wanna spend time to constumize a set.

  If you don't have / can't affort some of the items used in these sets, read below to check if it has alternative piece.

## [Armor Best-in-Slot set](https://www.ohthemisery.tk/builder/m=The%20Earthshaker&o=Tear%20of%20the%20Moon&h=Rootweave%20Diadem&c=Bound%20Spirit's%20Tunic&l=Eternity&b=Chains%20of%20Entropy)

153.6% Speed as base.

Damage Reduction doesn't rely on Situational Enchantments like *Reflex* in Agi BiS set.

*Curse Of Anemia* 2, so healing is a huge problem.

*Curse Of Corruption* has been consumed.

## [Agi Best-in-Slot set](https://www.ohthemisery.tk/builder/m=The%20Earthshaker&o=Dragonbone%20Dagger&h=Vivac%C3%A9&c=Departure&l=Galemage's%20Greaves&b=Mist's%20Wake)

132% Speed as base. *Adrenaline 5* (+50% Speed for 3 seconds Potion Effect upon attack, +25% for 6 seconds upon break spawner), so 198% Speed upon attack, 165% upon break spawner.

*Curse Of Corruption* has been consumed.

## [Agi budget set](https://www.ohthemisery.tk/builder/m=The%20Earthshaker&o=Merchant's%20Curio&h=Crest%20of%20the%20Tundra&c=Phasing%20Chestplate&l=Galemage's%20Greaves&b=Mist's%20Wake)

138% Speed as base.

Generally higher Damage Reduction than BiS. *Tempo* 1 doesn't really exist.

Melee damage sucks a bit.

## [Agi IDNWTGDDWDIU set](https://www.ohthemisery.tk/builder/m=The%20Earthshaker&o=Studded%20Gauntlet&h=Vivac%C3%A9&c=Departure&l=Jeans%20of%20the%20Fire%20Eagle&b=Mist's%20Wake)

I Do Not Want To Get Dragonbone Dagger What Do I Use

125% Speed as base. *Adrenaline* 5, so 187.5% Speed upon attack, 156.25% upon break spawner.

Generally around the same Damage Reduction with budget set. 

## [Agi PGMWYARSS set](https://www.ohthemisery.tk/builder/m=The%20Earthshaker&o=Studded%20Gauntlet&h=Vivac%C3%A9&c=Departure&l=Galemage's%20Greaves&b=Blackthread%20Boots)

Please Get Mist's Wake You Are Running So Slow

105% Speed as base. *Adrenaline* 5, so 157.5% Speed upon attack, 131.25% upon break spawner.

Better Blast Damage Reduction.

## [Agi DPS set](https://www.ohthemisery.tk/builder/m=Titan%20Spear&o=Accident%20Prone&h=Horseman's%20Head&c=Crusadoth&l=Salazar's%20Greed&b=Sailwoven%20Sandals)

Infusions: TFF / Ruin / EC / (Orange / Pink / LB / Teal)

*To be Verified:* Since *Slowness* doesn't affect bosses anymore therefor there is no need to get Yellow nor Magenta.

## [Armor DPS set](https://www.ohthemisery.tk/builder/m=Titan%20Spear&o=Accident%20Prone&h=Mage%20Hunter's%20Mask&c=The%20Godshell&l=Chains%20from%20Below%20the%20Waves&b=Bark%20of%20the%20Gateway%20Tree)

*I have **NEVER** tried Armor DPS set before, and it has to get Grace 5 to work.*

## [Tank set](https://www.ohthemisery.tk/builder/m=Truest%20North-3&o=Dryadic%20Temptation&h=The%20Knight's%20Pledge&c=The%20Godshell&l=Iridium%20Greaves&b=Old%20Ice%20Brogues)

Replacement for helmet: FGC. Replacement for leggings: Cephalopodic Chains.

**4 HP is your danger zone where you get 2 shot with my set.** Pop your IH2 / Absorption / Totem / Tincture once you fall into it.

# Options in Slot:
  Here's more details about what piece is good for this slot. (Nothing about armor set because I'm not familar with that.)

## Pickaxe:

- **The Earthshaker**

12 Mining Speed. 13 ticks (0.65s) / (with *Haste* 1 Potion Effect) 11 ticks (0.55s) to break a spawner. 

Gives you better Damage Reduction and Knockback Resistance which both really helps a lot when breaking spawners.

Recommend to use it with *Haste*.

- **Dionaeas Graft**

11 Mining Speed. 14 ticks (0.7s) / 12 ticks (0.6s) to break a spawner.

Budget EShaker which has no defence stats and a bit lesser healing but do be cheap enough.

*Eruption* can trigger *Sapper*, yes, but in actual scenario teammates is not that close to each other usually.

Recommend to use it with *Haste* (to get lesser hit while breaking spawners).

- **Ocean's Bounty**

16 Mining Speed. 10 ticks (0.5s) / 8 ticks (0.4s) to break a spawner.

Not recommond unless using it with either *Haste* or *Regen* (to get other consistance healing source) potion.

- **Shattershrine**

The same Mining stats as above.

*Adrenaline* speed ups the clear stage a lot.

The same survivability as Ocean's Bounty.

- **Boreas Mattock**

23 Mining Speed. 7 ticks (0.35s) / 6 ticks (0.3s) to break a spawner.

It's fast enough to called **game chaging**. Mobs can never catch you even you get slow'd. Only things could hit you while running are mobs just spawned or magic skill.

The same survivability as Ocean's Bounty.

*Curse Of Corruption* has been consumed.

## Misc mainhand:

- **True(r/st) North**

I can't think of any reason you don't need it.

- **Moon Mirror Shield**

Count as a melee weapon so it can cast ability while also function as a shield.

- **Phoenix's Gaze**

Not only a decent weapon but also can break (sometimes) wooden block above the reward chest.

- **Dissolvi Ombre**

Kill the plants faster in F1 boss fight.

- **Aleph** / **Poacher's Rifle** / **Carcano 91/38** / **K'x'aehdd**

Kill the eyes faster in f3 boss fight. (*To be Verified:* You only need to deal ~32 damage to each eyes and they will bleed to death)

## Offhand:

- **Dragonbone Dagger**

BiS Speed. *Regen* 1 is pretty sweet in scenarios like spawner rush or lootrun where you don't have much time to heal.

- **Merchant's Curio**

BiS general defence. Budget Speed.

- **Studded Gauntlet**

BiS *Reflex*. Good general defence. Lack of Speed.

## Helmet:

- **Vivace**

BiS Speed. Good general defence.

- **Crest of the Tundra**

BiS general defence. *Curse Of Corruption* has been consumed.

## Chestplate:

- **Departure**

BiS Speed. Great general defence. *Curse Of Corruption* has been consumed.

- **Phasing Chestplate**

BiS Speed which isn't *Adrenaline*. Good general defence. No need to worry about durability.

- **Bounty Hunter's Gambeson**

Not really a good choice but BiS Knockback Resistance. Good general defence (better than Phasing without Situational Enchantments on).

- **Emblem of the Last Gift**

Not really a good choice unless you happen to have it. Worse *Reflex* slot.

## Leggings:

- **Galemage's Greaves**

BiS *Reflex*. Not bad general defence with good Melee Damage Reduction.

- **Jeans of the Fire Eagle**

BiS Speed. Good general defence. No need to worry about durability.

- **Fractured Threads**

BiS Speed. Not bad general defence with good Melee Damage Reduction.

- **Lyrata**

BiS Speed. Not bad general defence. *Regen* 1 as sweet spot. No need to worry about durability.

- **Wit's End**

BiS Damage Reduction. -2 HP kinda hurtfor EHP wise. (Use with Vitality?)

## Boots:

- **Mist's Wake**

BiS *Reflex*. Good Speed. Good general defence. No need to worry about durability.

- **Blackthread Boots**

BiS general defence. +5% Speed as Sweet spot. No need to worry about durability.

# Hotbar Recommonds:

  Not have to get them but it's such a good-to-have

- **Any *Recoil* item**

Gives you greater mobility, especially on vertical, which helps you escape from mob sea or quick build up.

- **Loom**

Using with *Recoil* item gives you infinity survivability in clutch. Also very useful against Seeker's laser, or could also be used as blocking the entrance of room to get rid of mobs.

- **Shield**

Creepers is a heavy damage source, which you can block them with a shield. Also can be useful in some cases your hp is low but threat is very close to you.

- **Axe**

Sometimes chest will spawn under a wooden block, which will cost years to break, and mobs are apporching you every milisecond. An axe will slove this issue.

- **Heart of the Jungle**

Nice healing and foodbar-filling item, but with a long Cooldown so better save it when you really need it.

# Consumables:

  \* means Not Must!!

- ***(Empowered) Azure Mixture**

Low last. Cheap. Use 2-3 per 1 complete usually.

- ***Strong Dichen Energy Brew**

Low last. Cheap. Use 2-3 per 1 complete usually.

- ***Extract of the Eternal**

Long last. Cheap if you run a lot. Use 1 per 3 completion usually.

- ***Bathypelagic Brew**

Extra mining speed boost comes from *Conduit Power*, seperate with *Haste*.

- **Sliver of Perfection** / **Fruits of the Catch** / (Porkchop, directly drops 1 stack from 1 completion of ndd)

## Consumables as DPS:
  
*3 of each kind per 1 completion.*

- **Wolfswood's Fury** (r3 loot chest / Portal complete / GS complete / SKT complete)

- **Charger's Lager** (Can be found in Molta bar).

## Consumables as Tank:

  \* means Not Must!!

*Regen* 3 Potion effect, which is 1.6 HP / 12 ticks (0.6s) .

*Directly drops from dd.*

## Utility rooms

- Gamble skills

**Never touch the botton as you have 1 useful ability.**

**NEVER EVER EVER touch the botton if you don't want to roll it for yourself**

- Remove skills (f1 only)

Remove the one skill which will conflict with your core skill.

- Borrow skills (f2 only)

Idk what to explain, just choose something you want but not in your trees.

- Dummy and Disc (f3 only)

The button offers 1 treasure point so don't forget to do that. Doesn't lose its effect after opening a new room.

- Potions

Leave potions to DPS (or Tank if you are good enough to take care of DPS) for tanking f3 boss skill (or f2 if something goes incrediblely wrong) while DPSing.

# Misc Tips

- Don't be too harry opening new room. Treasure chest has to be claimed manually to get the treasure score added into your run.

- You can claimed your ability / upgrade by right click on your Depth Trinket. Do that upon treasure room get opened so you don't have to speedrun ability / upgrade picking to get the treasure.

- Block the entrance of boss room really helps. You can't directly place blocks on the outline so be careful while using Firm, although Loom can do it in 1 click instead. If you have ton of mobs aggro on you, better not rush into boss room to make sure mobs doesn't enter boss room as well. They can make the game 50% more harder for DPS.

- Don't be too harry starting boss at f1. DPS has to swap thier loadout, drink several potions and eat FoL. If you start the boss, the Armory/EChest GUI currently opening will be closed. Cannot kill f1 boss in 1 phase will waste even more time than just wait for DPS.

- The Void Blast casted by those invisible vexes in f2 can be silenced.

- Build up 2 blocks while there's piglin aggro on you when f3 boss started. They can't reach you and always aggro on you (due to a bug: They should change aggro on the one who they cast tp spell onto), so DPS can shred them lot simpler. There's also no need to dodge boss's spell if piglins are still alive, since none of the spell will 1 shot you if your HP is above 50%.

- The amount of adds summoned in boss fight is scaled by the people amount once the boss fight start. In NDD, mostly seen in f2 and f3.

- Attack those adds summoned in boss fight. It pulls aggro to you so that DPS can have a better environment. Don't come too close to boss in f2 / f3 though.

- Due to the ranged mob's path finding AI, place the blocks like this will make it cannot directly shoot at DPS (numbers means block height, x means it's where you place blocks initially, which will cause ranged mob able to shoot at DPS).

- The Earth skill Stone Skin (Sneak + RMB) only affects yourself unlike Defence Line. Radiant Blessing gives Resistance instead of Speed unlike Celeste Blessing.

- **Very Many Important** The iframe in Monumenta is seperated by Melee / Projectile / Magic. Some of the skills ignore iframes as well but we don't talk about them too much here. In this case, if A deals 50 damage with thier melee attack first, then B deals 100 damage with thier melee attack within the same iframe, the final damage taken by the enemy is 100 (50 melee damage by A and 50 melee damage by B). But if A deals 50 damage with thier projectile attack first, then B deals 100 damage with thier melee attack within the same iframe, the final damage taken by the enemy is 150 (50 projectile damage by A and 100 melee damage by B). Skills like Flamestrike has their iframe seperate with itself (just like how you can't spam Alch potion on one enemy), means it doesn't and also can't be affect by iframes created by other attacks. This rules not only works for DD but also ALL other content. Outside of DD, skills like Rampage / Cloak and Dagger have more issue with iframe. In the previous case 'A deals 50 melee damage first then B deals 100 melee damage within the same iframe, A dealt 50 damage so get 50 damage count towards to Rampage, while B dealt 100 damage but only get 50 damage count towards to Rampage.
> TL;DR: If you are DPS, nothing really should be done. If you are not DPS but want to do something to boss, either do nothing instead, or attack boss with a projectile weapon / magic spell.

- A vanilla trick that, the blast damage taken is calculated by how many % of you are exposed to the explosive, which in the case, the explosion start from the bottom of creeper hitbox. By placing a block in front of yourself between explosive, you can negative the blast damage taken to only 10% or even lesser (depends on the hardness of the block). Of course, in most case shield will do better than this.
> Showcase of 'placing a block in front of yourself between explosive'. C means creeper, P means player, Q means block.
> 
>		C		P
>		C	Q	P

- *Not directly about NDD.* Sell your geode at mid price of stonkco at bazzar or somewhere else instead of dump them to stonkco, in which will make geode price becomes lower and lower, so that you get lesser and lesser profit from NDD.

- *Same above.* Artifacts can be trade to 8 geode at NPC, so before you price your artifact, check if it's lower than just trade them for geode.

# List of skilled Players I've known during my NDD Speedrun grind
  Will also mark out the role they main. I main DPS most of time so some of them may have DPS set as well but I don't know about it.
