# What is NDD-Plus?
This is a general guide about optimizing builds, routes and stragedies to minimize the average completion time of NDD without losing too much loot, to get better and ideally the best loot per unit time.

# How much do you get from doing NDD speedrun?
My average completion time is about 9-12 minutes with a 4 poeple team. Changes as the overall skill level of team and RNGs like rooms' generation and skills.
The average loot from my completion is about 2.25-2.75 hcs, 7-9 geode, 1/3 chance for 1 artifact.

# I barely know anything about DD.

NDD speedrun is different from NDD. You can complete NDD with progress of post Purple but there's a huge chance that you cannot even survive in f1 during speedrun. It requires good gear (several epics, even) and a basic knowledge of rooms' layout.

# Say something at last to make it looks epic.
You will never get good if you never go try it.
But even you are confidence enough to yourself, be aware.
