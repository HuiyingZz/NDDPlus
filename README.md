## About NDD Speedrun

Builds, gameplay and stragedies to minimize the average completion time of NDD without losing too much loot, to get better and ideally the best loot per unit time.

### How much do you get from doing NDD speedrun?

My average completion time is about 9-12 minutes with a 4 poeple team. Changes as the overall skill level of team and RNGs like rooms and skills.

The average loot from my completion is about 2.25-2.5 hcs, 7-8 geode, about 1/3 chance for 1 artifact.
